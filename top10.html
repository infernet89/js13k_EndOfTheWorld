	<p>Here my personal top 10 of js13kGames. They are not in order, see FAQ.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://js13kgames.com/entries/cave-explorer">Cave Explorer</a><p>Even if there are only two levels, the mechanic is very interesting and the physics of fluid is awesome. Worth your time!</p></li>
		<li><a href="http://js13kgames.com/entries/elematter">Elematter</a><p>This is here probably only because i LOVE tower defense games. This is very pleasurable to see.</p></li>
		<li><a href="http://js13kgames.com/entries/rescue-copter">Rescue Copter</a><p>Amazing graphic style and very fun endless arcade gameplay. And it's really polished.</p></li>
		<li><a href="http://js13kgames.com/entries/elemental-block-shooters">Elemental Block Shooters</a><p>This is fun! The graphic style is very clever and the sounds are perfect for the design. The gameplay is nothing really new, but is fun to be played.</p></li>
		<li><a href="http://js13kgames.com/entries/radial">Radial</a><p>Usally I'm not a big fan of frantic arcade games, but this is different. The moving pattern actually change after a while, making it a very fun challenge!</p></li>
		<li><a href="http://js13kgames.com/entries/pest-control-weasels">Pest Control : Weasels</a><p>This is not only a perfect lemmings clone, it actually create a reverted gameplay on it. My only complain is on the level design, a bit trivial.</p></li>
		<li><a href="http://js13kgames.com/entries/element-puzzle">Element Puzzle</a><p>A real puzzle game, based on 4 elements. The levels are very well designed and I felt smart and rewarded every time i completed one. A nice game!</p></li>

		<li><a href="http://js13kgames.com/entries/strata">Strata</a><p>A little bit repetitive gameplay, but very visually rewarding!</p></li>
		<li><a href="http://js13kgames.com/entries/virtual-war">Virtual War</a><p>A perfect old-school game, with old-school-like graphics and awesome animations. And FUN to play.</p></li>

			<h3>Which is your game?</h3>
			<p>My game isn't in the list. I'm not here for shameless self promotion. I just want to show some love to developers that made a nice work. That doesn't mean that I didn't think I deserve a top 10. My <a href="http://js13kgames.com/entries/the-end-of-the-world">The END of the WORLD</a> has a really cool design, and I hope someone will notice it. But lots of developers has made AMAZING games, and they deserve more attentions that mine.</p>

			<h3>Why my game isn't here? It even have a FullHD scene from Avatar in 3D under 13kb.</h3>
			<p>Well, it's time to hate me. I've seen some games that are technically astonishing. Really. One for all: <a href="http://js13kgames.com/entries/jolly-rogier-shipwrecked">Jolly Rogier: Shipwrecked</a>. These games for me are like Jazz music (or farts). Only who like to made things like this will like them. That doesn't mean I don't like them. I simply didn't find them fun. (sorry @dgoeamans! I'm probably just jealous of your skills!)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>My game was awesome, you simply didn't understand that!</h3>
			<p>Right, that's possible. This is just my opinion. For instance I really get bored at strategic games. That's why I'm not a judge.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Why the list isn't ordered?</h3>
			<p>I can't decide who is better than what. It's too hard. Poord judges, they will have to take really hard decisions</p>
